## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, I appreciate your help in disclosing it.

**Please raise a new Issue on the GitHub repository.**

As this is an open-source hobby project, I do not have a private disclosure program. When opening an issue, please:

1.  **Describe the vulnerability** clearly.
2.  **Do NOT include real API keys, tokens, or personal data** in your public issue. Please redact any sensitive information (e.g., replace Client Secrets with `REDACTED`).
3.  Provide steps to reproduce the issue if possible.
